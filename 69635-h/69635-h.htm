<p class="center"><b><i>I. Radioactive Substances.</i></b></p>

<p>
<i>Becquerel Rays</i>. <i>Uranium and Thorium</i>.&mdash;We call
radioactive such substances as are capable of emitting spontaneously and
continuously certain rays known as Becquerel rays. These rays act upon
the photographic plate; they render the gases through which they pass
conductors of electricity; they can pass through black paper and metals.
The Becquerel rays cannot be reflected, refracted or polarized.
</p>
<p>
In 1896 Becquerel discovered that uranium and its compounds emit these
new rays continuously. Schmidt and Mme. Curie then found almost
simultaneously that thorium compounds are also radioactive. The
radiations emitted by thorium compounds are comparable in intensity with
those from the compounds of uranium. Radioactivity is an atomic property
that accompanies the atoms of uranium and thorium wherever they are
found; in a compound or a mixture its intensity is proportional to the
amount of the metal present.
</p>
<p>
<i>New Radioactive Substances</i>.&mdash;Mme. Curie, in 1898, tried to
learn whether there were among the elements then known any others
possessing radioactivity; she could not find a single substance giving
any considerable radiation, and concluded that the radioactive
properties of the elements are at least 100 times more feeble than those
of uranium and thorium. She found, on the other hand, that certain
minerals containing uranium (pitchblende, chalcolite, and carnotite) are
more active than metallic uranium; the activity of these minerals could
not, then, be due solely to uranium or to other known elements. This
discovery was fertile with new results. Mme. Curie and I showed, in an
investigation carried on together, that pitchblende contains new
radioactive substances, and we supposed that these substances contained
new chemical elements.
</p>
<p>
There are known with certainty three new strongly radioactive
substances: polonium, which was found in the bismuth obtained from the
uranium minerals; radium, found with barium from the same source, and
actinium, which was discovered by Debierne among the rare earths
extracted from the same minerals. These three substances are present
only in infinitesimal quantities in the uranium minerals, and all three
possess a radioactivity about a million times greater than that of
uranium or thorium.
</p>
<p>
Recently Giesel and Hofmann announced the presence of a fourth strongly
radioactive substance in the uranium minerals, which had properties
closely resembling those of lead; from the publications that have
appeared up to this time I have not been able to form an opinion as to
the nature of this substance.
</p>
<p>
It may be asked whether radioactivity is a general property of matter.
This question cannot be regarded as actually settled. The investigations
of Mme. Curie have proved that the different known substances do not
possess an atomic radioactivity one-hundredth as great as that of
uranium or thorium. On the other hand, certain chemical reactions may
cause the formation of ions, conductors of electricity, without the
active substance giving any evidence of atomic radioactivity. Thus white
phosphorus by its oxidation renders the surrounding air a conductor of
electricity, while red phosphorus and the phosphates are not at all
radioactive.
</p>
<p>
Some old experiments by Russell, Colson and Tengyel showed that certain
substances act upon the photographic plate at a distance. It is possible
that this phenomenon is partly due to radioactivity, but it is not
certain. Recent work by MacTennan and Burton, Strutt, and Lester Cooke,
leads to the supposition that radioactivity belongs to all bodies to an
extremely slight extent. The identity of these very feeble phenomena
with atomic radioactivity can not yet be regarded as proved.
</p>
<p>
<i>Radium</i>.&mdash;Of all the strongly radioactive substances radium is
the only one that has been proved to be a new element. Radium possesses a
characteristic spectrum, the discovery and first study of which we owe
to Demarçay, and which has since been studied by Runge and Precht and
by Crookes. Radium is an element belonging after barium in the series of
alkaline earths. Its atomic weight as determined by Mme. Curie is 225.
</p>
<p>
At present radium is obtained from a residue left on extracting uranium
from pitchblende. This residue contains 2 or 3 decigrams of radium in a
ton. At first 10 or 15 kilograms of radiferous barium salt are extracted
from a ton of the residue, and from this the radium is prepared by
fractional crystallization (with the chloride or bromide), the crystals
that form from the solution being richer in radium than the salt that
remains in the liquid.
</p>
<p>
The radiant activity of the radium salt can be measured at different
times from the beginning of crystallization until it is finally dried in
the air-bath. It is found that the activity has a certain initial value,
then it increases as a function of the time, at first rapidly, then more
and more slowly; it approaches asymptotically a limiting value which is
about five times as great as the initial activity. The activity then
remains invariable for some years if the salt be left as it is.
</p>
<p>
<i>Polonium</i>.&mdash;Polonium is, on the contrary, a substance that
slowly loses its radioactivity from the moment when it is separated from
the uranium mineral containing it. After some years the radioactivity of
polonium almost completely disappears. Hence it acts like an unstable
substance. It has not yet been shown that polonium is a new element
distinct from ordinary bismuth.
</p>
<p>
Polonium can be concentrated by fractionally precipitating the
subnitrate of polonium and bismuth by means of water. The part
precipitated is the most active. One can also make a partial
precipitation by means of hydrogen sulphide from a strongly acid
solution in hydrochloric acid. These methods of fractionation are
difficult because the precipitates are not easily redissolved. Marckwald
concentrated the activity by plunging a rod of bismuth in a solution of
bismuth and polonium. A layer of extremely active metal was deposited
upon the rod.
</p>
<p>
<i>Actinium</i>.&mdash;The concentration of actinium is even more
difficult than that of polonium. Solid salts containing actinium
preserve their radioactivity unchanged for several years.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="center"><b><i>II. The Radiations from Radioactive Substances.</i></b></p>

<p>
<i>Complexity of the Radiation</i>.&mdash;Radium is the substance
whose radioactivity has been studied most completely. It is
now known that it emits a number of rays of different nature,
which can be placed in three groups. According to the notation
adopted by Rutherford, I designate the three groups of
rays by the letters <i>α</i>, <i>β</i>, and <i>γ</i>.
</p>
<p>
The action of the magnetic field serves to distinguish them.
In an intense magnetic field the <i>α</i>-rays are slightly deviated
from a straight path, and the deviation is of the same kind as
that of the "canal" rays of Goldstein in a vacuum-tube. On
the other hand, the <i>β</i>-rays are deviated like the cathode rays,
and the <i>γ</i>-rays are not turned aside, but act like the Roentgen
rays.
</p>
<p>
<i>β-Rays</i>.&mdash;The <i>β</i>-rays of radium, analogous to the
cathode rays, form a heterogeneous group. They are distinguished
from one another by their power of penetration and by the
deviation caused by a magnetic field.
</p>
<p>
Certain <i>β</i>-rays are absorbed by aluminium foil a few hundreths of
a millimeter in thickness, while others pass through several millimeters
of lead.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we have a rectilinear pencil of Becquerel rays obtained
by means of a particle of radium salt and a screen with
a hole in it. If a uniform magnetic field is produced normal to
the direction of the pencil the <i>β</i>-rays are incurved, and describe
circular paths in a plane normal to the direction of the magnetic
field. The rays of the described circumferences vary
within wide limits. Becquerel has shown that the most penetrating
rays are least deviated, and hence describe circumferences
with the greatest radius of curvature. If the pencil of <i>β</i>-rays
bent aside by the magnetic field is allowed to fall on
the photographic plate, there is obtained an impression that
is a true spectrum in which the different <i>β</i>-rays act separately.
</p>
<p>
Suppose the <i>β</i>-rays to be projectiles (electrons) negatively
charged with electricity and shot from the radium with great
velocity. Let <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(m\)"> be the mass of a projectile, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(e\)"> its
charge, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(v\)"> its initial velocity, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 3.421ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/4.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(rho\)"> the radius of curvature
of its path, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm H\)"> the intensity of the magnetic field
normal to the initial velocity, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 3.281ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/6.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(mu\)"> the magnetic permeability
of the medium. We then have the easily established relation
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.489ex; width: 19.685ex; height: 4.109ex;" src="images/7.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
\mu H \rho = \frac{mv}{e} \qquad\text{(1)}.
\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>

<p class="nind">
The <i>β</i>-rays are also deviated in an electric field. Suppose we
have a rectilinear pencil of these rays. If a uniform electric field be
produced normal to the initial direction of the pencil, the rays are
deviated in the opposite direction to the field, and describe parabolic
paths. The experiment can be performed by passing the pencil of rays
between two parallel metallic plates, between which there is established
a difference of potential. The deviation is slight with the means one
has at command, and it is convenient to work in a vacuum. The air is made
a conductor of electricity, so that if we work in the air the
insulation is imperfect, and it is difficult to maintain a constant
and high difference of potential between the plates. The most
penetrating <i>β</i>-rays are bent aside least.
</p>
<p>
The action of the electric field is in accord with the ballistic
hypothesis previously stated. Accepting this hypothesis, suppose a
uniform electric field with an intensity <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.595ex;" src="images/8.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(h\)"> and a width <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.414ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/9.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm L\)">,
acts upon the charged projectile whose initial velocity is normal
to the field. The deviation, <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.109ex; height: 1.464ex;" src="images/10.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(y\)">, of the extremity of the trajectory
at the departure from the field is given by formula (2), when the
deviation is slight.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.15ex; width: 20.83ex; height: 5.432ex;" src="images/11.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{h \mathrm L^2}{2y} = \frac{mv^2}{e} \qquad\text{(2)}.
\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>

<p>
From the equations (1) and (2) can be deduced the velocity, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(v\)">, of
the projectiles, and the ratio, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(e\)">/<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(m\)">, of the
electric charge to the corresponding mass.
</p>
<p>
The experiments of Becquerel have shown that for the <i>β</i>-rays of
greatest intensity the ratio, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(e\)">/<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(m\)">, approaches
10<sup>7</sup> electromagnetic units, and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(v\)"> a value of
1.6 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec. These values are of the
same order of magnitude as for the cathode rays.
</p>
<p>
Kaufmann has made exact experiments on the same subject. This physicist
subjected a very narrow pencil of radium rays to the simultaneous action
of a magnetic and an electric field, both fields being uniform and
acting normal to the primary direction of the pencil. The pencil is
received upon a photographic plate placed perpendicular to its initial
direction. In the absence of the two fields the impression on the plate
is a small circular disk, almost like a point. When the magnetic field
acts alone the different <i>β</i>-rays are unequally deflected but
remain in a plane normal to the field, producing upon the plate an
impression in the form of a straight line. When the electric field acts
alone the different <i>β</i>-rays are unequally deflected in a plane
passing through the field and producing upon the plate an impression
which is a straight line perpendicular to the one preceding. When both
fields act simultaneously the impression on the plate is a curve. Each
point of the curve corresponds to a different kind of <i>β</i>-ray.
Taking as axes of coordinates on the plate the straight lines obtained
when each of the two fields acts alone, the coordinates of each point of
the curve represent the relative magnetic and electric deviations for
each kind of ray.
</p>
<p>
The following are the figures for <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.097ex; height: 1.027ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(v\)"> and <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(e\)">/<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(m\)">

<p>
It is seen that certain <i>β</i>-rays have a velocity approaching that
of light. One can understand why it is that particles having such
velocity should be able to penetrate matter to such an extent, although
they are so small.
</p>
<p>
The ratio <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(e\)">/<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(m\)">, seems to be the same for the least
penetrating radium rays and the cathode rays. But this ratio diminishes
as the velocity of the rays increases. J. J. Thomson and Townsend think
that all charged electrons, when in motion, possess the same charge,
which is equal to that carried by an atom of hydrogen when a solution is
electrolyzed. If that be true, it must be admitted that the mass of the
particles increases with their velocity, when the latter approaches that
of light.
</p>
<p>
In the case of electrolysis the ratio, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(e\)">/<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(m\)">, is
equal to 9650, while this same ratio is equal to 1.865 x 10<sup>7</sup>
for the cathode rays and the less penetrating <i>β</i>-rays. If it be
admitted that the charge, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(e\)">, is the same in both cases, it can be
deduced that the mass of an electron is about two thousand times less
than that of an atom of hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
Theoretical considerations lead to the conception that the inertia of a
particle is solely due to its being a moving charge, the velocity of a
moving electric charge not being altered without some change of energy.
In other words, the mass of the charged particle is, in part at least,
an apparent mass or an electromagnetic mass. Abraham gave a formula for
calculating the electromagnetic mass of a charged particle as
a function of its velocity. According to this formula the mass due to
electromagnetic reactions is a constant for low velocities; it increases
with the velocity, and approaches infinity for velocities that approach
that of light. The experiments of Kaufmann are in accord with this
theory, and also lead to the conclusion that the mass of an electron is
entirely of an electromagnetic nature. These results are of great
theoretical importance. One can foresee the possibility of establishing
mechanics upon the dynamics of small material centers charged and in
motion.
</p>

<p>
<i>α-Rays</i>.&mdash;The <i>α</i>-rays of radium have very
little power of penetration. A piece of aluminium foil a few hundredths
of a millimeter in thickness absorbs them almost completely. They are
also absorbed by the air, and cannot penetrate air at the atmospheric
pressure to a greater distance than 10 cm. The <i>α</i>-rays form the
most important part of the radiation of radium, provided we measure the
radiation by the amount of ionization which it produces in the air.
</p>
<p>
The <i>α</i>-rays are very slightly deflected by the most intense
magnetic and electric fields, and they were at first thought to
be non-deviable under this influence. Nevertheless, independently
of the action of the magnetic field, the laws of the absorption
of the <i>α</i>-rays by superimposed screens is sufficient
to distinguish them clearly from the Roentgen rays. In passing
through successive screens the rays become less and less
penetrating, while the penetrating power of the Roentgen rays
increases. The ray is like a projectile whose energy diminishes
on passing through each screen. A given screen also absorbs
the <i>α</i>-rays to a much greater extent when it is placed
at a distance than when it is placed quite near the radium.
</p>
<p>
Strutt suggested that the rays might be analogous to the canal rays of
vacuum-tubes. Rutherford succeeded in showing the action of a magnetic
field upon the rays and in making a preliminary measurement of the
deviation. Becquerel confirmed the results obtained by Rutherford and
gave a new measurement of the phenomenon. Des Coudres measured the
electrical and magnetic deviation of the rays in a vacuum.
</p>
<p>
From these investigations it is seen that the <i>α</i>-rays act like
projectiles having a great velocity and charged with electricity.
The deviation in a magnetic field and in an electric field is the
opposite of the deviation of the cathode rays.
</p>
<p>
The <i>α</i>-rays form an apparently homogeneous group, all being
deflected to the same extent and, hence, not giving a spread-out
spectrum as the rays do. The formulas (1) and (2) are applicable.
According to the measurements of Des Coudres in a vacuum,

<p>
Hence the velocity of the particles is twenty times less than
that of light. If we assume that the charge of a particle is
the same as that of an atom of hydrogen, in electrolysis, it is
found that its mass is of the same order of magnitude as the
hydrogen atom (the ratio, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.054ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(e\)">/<img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.986ex; height: 1.025ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(m\)">, is equal to 9650
for hydrogen in electrolysis). It may well be supposed that these
particles, which are greater than the electrons and have a lower velocity,
would be less capable of penetration.
</p>
<p>
According to the experiments of Becquerel, the curvature of the path of
the <i>α</i>-rays moving in a uniform magnetic field is not constant
when in air at the atmospheric pressure. At first the curvature is the
same as that obtained in a vacuum, but it becomes less and less as the
ray recedes from its source. This phenomenon can be explained by
supposing that new particles attach themselves to the projectiles that
make up the rays while the latter move through the air. This hypothesis
explains why the absorbing power of a screen for the <i>α</i>-rays
increases as it is removed farther from the radiant source.
</p>
<p>
The <i>α</i>-rays are the ones that are active in the very beautiful
experiments with the spinthariscope of Crookes. In this apparatus a very
small fragment of a salt of radium (a fraction of a milligram) is held
by a metallic thread a short distance (0.5 mm.) from a phosphorescent
screen of zinc sulphide. On examining, in the dark, the surface of the
screen which is toward the radium by means of a magnifying glass,
luminous points are seen sprinkled over the screen, reminding one of a
starry sky. These luminous points appear and disappear continuously.
From the ballistic theory it might be imagined that each luminous point
that appeared and disappeared resulted from the shock of a projectile.
This is the first instance of a phenomenon which enables one to
distinguish the individual action of an atom.
</p>

<p>
<i>γ-Rays</i>.&mdash;The rays are exactly like the Roentgen
rays. They seem to comprise but a small part of the total radiation.
The <i>γ</i>-rays have a very extraordinary power of penetration,
and they diffuse very little in passing through most substances.
</p>

<p>
<i>Diffusion of the Radium Rays</i>.&mdash;Suppose we have a
pencil of Becquerel rays issuing from radium and limited by a
screen of lead. If the pencil meets a thin screen the <i>α</i>-rays
are absorbed, the <i>β</i>-rays are diffused in all directions, and
the <i>γ</i>-rays go part way through the screen as a well-defined
pencil with sharp edges. The <i>γ</i>-rays can also pass through a
prism of thick glass as a well-defined straight pencil. The
question has been raised whether the <i>β</i>-rays are always completely
diffused when they penetrate a solid screen. The experiments
of Becquerel show that a pencil of <i>β</i>-rays can propagate
itself in a well defined way in paraffin. Becquerel made use
of the action of the <i>β</i>-rays on the photographic plate
to study the path of the rays when dispersed by a magnetic
field. It can be seen from the prints that the most penetrating
rays pass through 7 or 8 mm. of paraffin without marked
diffusion, while the least penetrating rays are completely
diffused after passing through 2 mm. The magnetic field deflects
the <i>β</i>-rays in paraffin as in air.
</p>

<p>
<i>Conductivity of Dielectric Liquids under the Influence of the Radium
Rays</i>.&mdash;Dielectric liquids become poor conductors under the
influence of the radium rays. This can be shown with petroleum, ether,
vaseline oil, benzene, amylene, carbon disulphide, and liquid air.
</p>

<p>
<i>Radiation of Other Radioactive Substances</i>.&mdash;Polonium emits
only very slightly penetrating rays, which seem to be identical
with the <i>α</i>-rays of radium. They possess almost the
same power of penetration and are deflected in the same way
by the magnetic field. Finally, the experiment of the spinthariscope
can be performed with the <i>α</i>-rays of polonium. Hence,
polonium is a source of the <i>α</i>-rays unmixed with other
kinds of rays, which is of value in certain studies. But the
source exhausts itself, and some years after it has been separated
from the minerals containing it the polonium loses its activity.
</p>
<p>
Thorium, uranium, and actinium seem to emit the <i>α</i>- and
<i>β</i>-rays; the deviability of the <i>β</i>-rays has been shown.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Electric Charge of the Radium Rays</i>.&mdash;According to the
ballistic theory, the <i>α</i>-rays should carry positive electric
charges and the <i>β</i>-rays negative electric charges. Mme.
Curie and I have shown that, in conformity to the theory,
the <i>β</i>-rays of radium charge positively the bodies that absorb
them. To show this, a plate of lead is connected with an
electrometer. The plate of lead is entirely covered with a
layer of paraffin, which is in turn enveloped in fine aluminium
foil connected with the earth. The radium, placed in a
small dish, sends its rays upon the plate of lead, which is
thus protected. The <i>α</i>-rays are stopped by the exterior
layer of aluminium. Part of the <i>β</i>-rays pass through the
aluminium and the paraffin and are absorbed by the lead,
which becomes charged negatively. The paraffin is necessary
to sufficiently insulate the plate of lead, which could be
charged if it were surrounded by air, for it is made a conductor
by Becquerel rays.
</p>
<p>
We have also shown that a salt of radium is charged positively
when it is enveloped in an insulating layer, and that it
emits <i>β</i>-rays from the exterior, while the <i>α</i>-rays cannot
escape.
</p>
<p>
A sealed glass bulb containing a salt of radium becomes spontaneously
charged like a Leyden jar. If after a sufficient time a mark is made on
the wall of the flask with a glass-cutter, a spark is discharged, which
pierces the glass at the point where it was made thin by the cutter. At
the same time the experimenter feels a slight shock in his fingers from
the passage of the discharge.
</p>

<p>
<i>Phosphorescence of Substances under the Action of the Becquerel Rays.
Light Emitted by Salts of Radium. Coloration of Substances by the Action
of the Rays</i>.&mdash;The radiation from radium causes phosphorescence
in a great many substances: the salts of the alkalies and alkaline
earths, uranyl-potassium sulphate, organic substances, cotton, paper,
cinchonine sulphate, skin, glass, quartz, etc. The most sensitive
substances are barium platinocyanide, willemite (silicate of zinc),
sulphide of zinc, and diamond. With the penetrating <i>β</i>-rays
willemite and the platinocyanide are the most sensitive, while with the
<i>α</i>-rays it is better to use phosphorescent sulphide of zinc.
</p>
<p>
Phosphorescent substances are altered by the prolonged action of the
radium rays. They become less excitable and are less luminous under the
influence of the rays. At the same time they change their color or
become colored. Glass becomes violet, black or brown. Salts of the
alkalies turn yellow, green or blue. Transparent quartz becomes smoky
quartz. Colorless topaz turns yellow, orange, etc. Glass colored by
radium is thermoluminescent. On heating it to 500° it emits light. At
the same time it becomes colorless and returns to its original
condition. It is then capable of being colored anew by the action of the
rays of radium.
</p>
<p>
The salts of radium are spontaneously luminous. It might be said that
they make themselves luminous by the action of the Becquerel rays they
emit. Anhydrous chloride and bromide of radium are the salts that give
the most intense luminescence. They may be obtained so luminous that the
light can be seen in full daylight. The light emitted by the salts of
radium recalls in tint that from a fire-fly. The luminosity of the
radium salt decreases with time without ever completely disappearing,
and those that were colorless at first become gray, yellow or violet.
</p>

<p>
<i>Physiological Effects of the Radium Rays</i>.&mdash;The rays from
radium cause different physiological actions.
</p>
<p>
A salt of radium placed in an opaque box made of cardboard or metal acts
on the eye and produces the sensation of light. To obtain this result,
the box containing the radium is placed before the closed eye or against
the temple. In this experiment the center of the eye becomes luminous by
phosphorescence under the influence of the radium rays, and the light
one sees has its source in the eye itself.
</p>
<p>
The rays of radium act on the epidermis. If we place on the skin for a
few minutes a bulb containing radium no particular sensation is felt.
But fifteen or twenty days afterward it produces a reddening of the
skin, then a slough in the place where the bulb was applied. If the
action of the rays be long enough there is finally formed a sore that
takes several months to heal. The action of the rays from radium is
analogous to that produced by the Roentgen rays. The attempt has been
made to utilize this action in the treatment of lupus and cancer.
</p>
<p>
The radium rays also act upon the nervous centers and cause paralysis
and death. (Danysz.) They seem also to act with especial intensity upon
growing tissues. (Bohn.)
</p>

<p>
<i>The Employment of Radium in the Study of Atmospheric
Electricity</i>.&mdash;The radium rays have also been utilized in the
study of atmospheric electricity (Paulsen, Witkowski, Moureaux). A small
quantity of a salt of radium placed at the extremity of a metallic rod
serves as a point of contact for the potential. By this very simple
arrangement we can avoid the use of flames or of water-dropping
apparatus to measure the potential at any point in the atmosphere.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h4><i>III. The Heat Given Off by the Salts of Radium.</i></h4>

<p>
The salts of radium continually give off heat. Its amount is sufficient
for it to be detected by means of a crude experiment with two ordinary
mercury thermometers. Two identical heat-insulating vacuum-bulbs are
used. In one of these is placed a glass bottle containing 0.7 gram of
pure radium bromide; in the second is placed a glass bottle containing
some inactive substance, such as barium chloride. The temperature of the
contents of each is shown by a thermometer placed with its bulb near the
bottle. The mouths of the flasks are closed with cotton. Under these
conditions the thermometer in the same flask as the radium always has a
temperature 3° higher than that indicated by the other thermometer.
</p>
<p>
The quantity of heat given off can be estimated by means of a Bunsen ice
calorimeter. By placing in the calorimeter a glass bottle containing a
salt of radium, it is found that there is a continued supply of heat
that stops as soon as the radium is removed. A determination made with a
salt of radium that had been prepared a long time before shows that each
gram of radium gives off 80 small calories an hour. Hence radium gives
off enough heat to melt its own weight of ice every hour. Nevertheless
the radium salt seems to remain in the same condition, and besides, not
a single ordinary chemical reaction can be called in to explain such a
continuous liberation of heat.
</p>
<p>
It has been shown, also, that a recently prepared salt of radium sets
free a relatively small amount of heat. The heat set free in a given
time then increases continually, and tends towards a definite value
which is not quite reached at the end of a month.
</p>
<p>
When a salt of radium is dissolved in water and the solution enclosed in
a sealed tube, the amount of heat given off at first is slight. It then
increases and tends to become constant at the end of a month. When the
limit is reached, the amount of heat given off from the radium in
solution is the same as if it were in the solid state.
</p>
<p>
The amount of heat set free by radium at different temperatures can also
be estimated by causing it to boil a liquefied gas and measuring the
volume of gas that is liberated. The experiment can be performed with
methyl chloride, which boils at -21°.

<p>
The experiment was also performed by Dewar and myself with liquid
oxygen (-180°) and liquid hydrogen (-252°). The latter is especially
suitable for the experiment. A tube, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, closed at the
lower end and surrounded by a Dewar vacuum-bulb, contains a little
liquid hydrogen, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm H\)">. A delivery-tube, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.633ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/14.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(tt\)">, allows
the gas to be collected in a graduated tube filled with water.
The tube, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, and its insulator are plunged into a bath
of liquid hydrogen, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/5.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm H\)"><code>'</code>. Under these
conditions no gas is produced in the tube <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">. When a bottle
containing 0.7 gram of radium bromide is placed in the hydrogen
in <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, there is a continuous liberation of hydrogen gas,
and 73 cc. of the gas are collected per minute. (The radium bromide
had been made only ten days before.)

<h4><i>IV. Induced Radioactivity and Radioactive Emanations.</i></h4>

<p>
<i>Induced Radioactivity</i>.&mdash;Radium, thorium, and actinium have
the property of acting externally, apart from the Becquerel rays that
they emit. They communicate little by little their radioactive
properties to substances in their neighborhood, and the latter emit in
turn Becquerel rays. The activity can be transmitted to gases, liquids,
and solids. The phenomenon is known as induced radioactivity.
</p>
<p>
Induced radioactivity propagates itself in gases step by step by a sort
of conduction, and is not at all due to direct radiation from the body
which causes it.
</p>
<p>
When the activated substance is removed from the radioactive body, the
induced radioactivity on it persists for a certain time. It diminishes,
nevertheless, little by little and finally disappears.
</p>

<p>
<i>Emanation</i>.&mdash;To explain these phenomena, Rutherford supposes
that radium and thorium are constantly giving off an unstable,
radioactive, gaseous material, which he calls an emanation. The
emanation spreads into the gas surrounding the radioactive substance. It
destroys itself little by little by giving off Becquerel rays and by
producing other unstable radioactive substances that are not volatile.
These new substances attach themselves to the surface of solid bodies
and render them radioactive.
</p>
<p>
Without stating so many hypotheses, we may adopt the name emanation to
designate the radioactive energy in the form which it has when it
spreads into the gas surrounding the radioactive substance. It may be
supposed also, that this energy disappears in creating the energy of
induced radioactivity in solids.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Radioactivity Induced by Radium and the Emanation from
Radium</i>.&mdash;When a solid salt of radium is placed in a closed
space filled with air, the interior walls of the closed space and all
solids in it become radioactive. We may, for example, place inside the
space a plate of any solid, leave it there a certain time, and then
remove it to study its activity. It is found that the activity of the
plate increases at first according to the length of its stay in the
space, but that it reaches a limiting value after a sufficiently long
time. When the excited plate is removed from the space it loses its
activity according to an exponential law, the radiation falling to
one-half its value in about half an hour. In a general way all solid
substances under the same conditions acquire and lose their activity in
the same manner.
</p>
<p>
The phenomena are much more intense (about twenty times), if instead of
the solid salt of radium, we place a solution of it inside the closed
space in an open vessel.
</p>
<p>
The nature and the pressure of the gas contained in the closed space
have no influence upon the observed phenomena.
</p>
<p>
The induced activity in a closed space is proportional to the
quantity of radium present.
</p>
<p>
When the space containing the radium communicates with a second by a
tube, solids contained in the second become equally active after a
sufficient time. The transmission of the activating property can even
take place from one to the other through a capillary tube.
</p>
<p>
When the gas which has been made active by remaining in one space
containing radium is passed into another, it retains for a considerable
time the property of rendering radioactive solids that are brought in
contact with it. The gas thus removed from the action of the radium
gradually loses, nevertheless, its power of causing radioactivity. It
disappears as a function of the time, according to an exponential law.
It loses one-half of its value every four days.
</p>
<p>
To interpret this phenomenon it must be assumed that radium continuously
gives off a constant radioactive emanation. This emanation spreads into
the air in a closed space, and acting on solids, makes them radioactive.
When the air is transferred to another space, the emanation is carried
along with it. Finally, it is destroyed spontaneously with such velocity
that the quantity of emanation in the gas diminishes by one-half every
four days.
</p>
<p>
In a space containing radium there is established a state of equilibrium
when the quantity of emanation in the space is such that the loss of
emanation resulting from its spontaneous destruction is exactly
compensated by the continued supply coming from the radium.

The following experiment can be performed: The glass receiver,
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)"> (Fig. II.), filled with air, communicates through the
constricted  part, <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.76ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm O\)">, with the bulb, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.602ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm B\)">, which
contains radium, <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.258ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/17.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm S\)">. At the end of a certain time the emanation
has spread into <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, and its interior walls have become active.
The receiver, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, is then separated from the radium by
closing <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.76ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm O\)"> with a flame. The external radiation of <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">
may then be studied by placing it in the interior cylinder of a
cylindrical condenser (Fig. III.). The interior cylinder is of
aluminium, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 6.753ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/18.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm BBBB\)">. It is brought to a potential of 500 volts.
The external cylinder, <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 6.792ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/19.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm CCCC\)">, of the condenser is of copper.
It is in connection with an electrometer and piezoelectric quartz. By
means of the quartz the current passing through the condenser is
measured. This current is caused by the Becquerel rays that escape from
the tube <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, pass through the cylinder of aluminium <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.602ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/20.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm
B\)">, and make the air between the two cylinders a conductor of
electricity. The apparatus is surrounded by a protective metallic
envelope, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 6.726ex; height: 1.538ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm EEEE\)">, connected with the earth.

<p>
It is found that the radiation from the tube <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)"> diminishes
with time according to an exact exponential law, expressed by the equation

as the unit of time. The radiation falls to one-half its value after
about four days.
</p>
<p>
In a second experiment the tube <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)"> may be made active as
before, and the interior can then be evacuated by pumping out the air
containing the emanation. Under these conditions the radiation of the
receiver, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, diminishes much more rapidly, and becomes twice
as feeble in about half an hour. This law of loss of activity is the
same as that according to which excited bodies lose their activity when
they are exposed to the free air. The result is the same if inactive air
be admitted to the receiver, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, after having been evacuated.
</p>
<p>
One is thus led to the conclusion that in the first experiment the
activity of the receiver, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, is caused by the air charged
with the emanation contained in the receiver, and that the law of the
diminution of the radiation in this experiment represents as well the
law of the spontaneous disappearance of the emanation.

<p>
When a vacuum is produced in the receiver, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, which contains
air charged with the emanation, and when the radiation of the receiver
is measured immediately after the extraction of the air, it is found
that the radiation has not changed at the moment when the active air is
withdrawn. The Becquerel radiation of air charged with the emanation
does not, then, produce any action in this experiment. This radiation
probably exists, but it is composed of very slightly penetrating rays,
incapable of passing through the glass wall. In this connection the
following experiment can be performed. One of the ends of the metallic
tube, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 6.787ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/26.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm AAAA\)"> (Fig. IV.), communicates at <img style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 1.76ex; height: 1.645ex;" src="images/15.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm O\)"> by
means of a rubber tube with a receiver, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.602ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/16.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm B\)">, in which is a
solution of a radium salt. The other end of the tube, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, is
closed with an insulating stopper, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.781ex; height: 1.52ex;" src="images/27.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(i\)">. Through the stopper passes a
metallic rod, <img style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 1.633ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm C\)">, connected with an electrometer. The tube,
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, and the rod, <img style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 1.633ex; height: 1.643ex;" src="images/28.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm C\)">, form a cylindrical condenser.
The tube, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, is brought to a potential of 500 volts. The
metallic tube, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 7.348ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/29.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm DDDD\)">, connected with the earth, serves as a
guard-tube. When the tube, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 1.697ex; height: 1.62ex;" src="images/13.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm A\)">, is sufficiently active it is
removed from the radium, and the intensity of the current passing
through the condenser is measured. Then the active air which fills the
condenser is rapidly driven out, inactive air is admitted, and a new
measurement of the intensity of the current is made immediately. It is
found that the current has become six times more feeble. Thus, during
the second measurement the radiation of the excited walls acts solely to
ionize the air in the condenser, while during the first measurement the
emanation acts as well. We may, then, suppose that it also emits an
emanation. This radiation is necessarily very slightly penetrating, for
its action cannot be detected on the exterior.
</p>
<p>
When a solid plate which has been excited by the emanation becomes
inactive in free air, the law of loss of activity depends on the time
during which the plate has been left in contact with the emanation. If
the action of the emanation is prolonged (more than twenty-four hours,
for example), the law of loss of activity is given by the difference
between two exponentials. The intensity of the radiation, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm I\)">,
may in this case be represented as a function of the time, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(t\)">, by the

and the representative curve has become straight. From this moment the
activity diminishes by one-half during each period of twenty-eight
minutes.

<p>
If the duration of the action of the emanation is not so long, the law
of the variation of the radiation during its loss is much more complex.
In Fig. V. are represented the results of experiments for different
times of action, as indicated on the corresponding curves. We see, for
example, that for a time of excitation of five minutes, the intensity of
the radiation during the loss of activity first falls rapidly to a
minimum; then it increases, and again begins to fall. Finally, the law
of loss of activity tends towards a simple exponential law which is the
same as the limiting law after prolonged excitation. These complex
phenomena can be explained by assuming that on the excited plate the
radioactive energy is in three distinct states, but the demonstrations
relative to this subject are too long to have a place in this article.
</p>
<p>
The emanation from radium causes the energetic phosphorescence of a
large number of substances. Glass reservoirs containing air charged with
the emanation are luminous, Thuringian glass being the most sensitive.
Phosphorescent sulphide of zinc is particularly sensitive to the action
of the emanation from radium, and then gives an intense light.
</p>
<p>
If in a closed space substances become more active the greater the
amount of free gas around them. When plates placed parallel to one
another, and a short distance apart, are put into a closed space with
radium, the faces of each plate become excited in proportion to its
distance from the others. When glass tubes of different diameters are
filled with the emanation and communicate with one another, the walls of
those of greatest interior diameter become most active. These tubes are
also most luminous. To interpret these facts it must be assumed that the
air charged with the emanation acts on the walls by a radiation that
arises in every part of the gaseous mass, and that the radioactivity
induced upon a wall is proportional to the flow of exciting radiation
received by that wall.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Slow Evolution of Induced Activity</i>.&mdash;A solid body
acquires a very feeble, persistent, induced activity when it remains a
month or less in contact with the radiation from radium. A substance
withdrawn from the influence of the emanation after having been
subjected to it for a long time loses its activity rapidly at first,
according to the laws given. But the activity of the radiation does not
disappear completely. There remains a radiation several thousand times
more feeble than it was at first. This radiation is given off with
extreme slowness and continues for several years. (The radiation passes
through a minimum, then slowly increases for several months, but always
remains very slight.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Occlusion of the Emanation of Radium by Solids</i>.&mdash;All solids
when excited by contact with the emanation from radium acquire the
property of themselves emitting the emanation in very small quantity.
They preserve this power for only twenty, minutes from the time they are
removed from the space containing the emanation. Nevertheless certain
substances as caoutchouc, paraffin, and celluloid have the property of
being saturated with the emanation, and of emitting it afterwards in
abundance for several hours, or even days.
</p>

<p>
<i>Induced Activity of Liquids</i>.&mdash;When a liquid is placed in a
closed space with radium it becomes radioactive. Water, salt solutions,
petroleum, etc., can thus be excited. The liquids dissolve a certain
amount of the emanation. When an excited liquid is separated from the
radium and sealed up in a tube it slowly loses its activity according to
the law of the destruction of the emanation (decrease to one-half in
four days). When the liquid is placed in a flask open to the air it
loses its activity very rapidly, and the emanation spreads into the
surrounding air.
</p>

<p>
<i>Variations of the Activity of Solutions of Radium Salts and of the
Solid Salts of Radium</i>.&mdash;When a solution of a salt of radium is
exposed to the air of a room in an open vessel it becomes almost
inactive. The solution emits an emanation that spreads into the room and
causes induced radioactivity of the walls. The radiation of the radium
is thus externalized. If the solution be enclosed in a sealed tube its
activity increases little by little, and tends toward a limiting value
that is reached only after several months. No doubt the emanation
produced by the radium accumulates in the tube until the velocity of its
spontaneous destruction is equalized by the supply from the radium.
</p>
<p>
We have seen that a salt of radium that has been freshly prepared
possesses an activity which increases with the time, and becomes about
five times as great as the initial activity. It seems that the emanation
emitted by the radium can escape only with difficulty from the solid
salt, and that it accumulates there and is transformed at once into
induced radiation. An equilibrium is established when the spontaneous
loss becomes sufficient to compensate the production.
</p>
<p>
When solid salt of radium is heated to redness, all the emanation which
it had accumulated escapes. When the salt returns to the temperature of
the room it emits Becquerel rays to a much less extent. However, the
radiation recovers little by little its original value, which is reached
after one or two months. The salt which had been heated to redness no
longer possesses the power of emitting the emanation, but this property
may be restored to it by dissolving it and drying it at a slightly
elevated temperature.
</p>

<p>
<i>Diffusion of the Emanation from Radium</i>.&mdash;Danne and I have
studied the law of the diffusion of the emanation of radium. A large
glass reservoir filled with excited air communicates with the atmosphere
by means of a capillary tube. The Becquerel radiation emitted by the
walls of the reservoir is measured as a function of the time, and from
this is deduced the law of the escape of the emanation through the
capillary tube. It is found that the rapidity of the escape of the
emanation is proportional to the quantity of it in the reservoir. It
varies proportionally to the cross section of the capillary tube, and
inversely as its length. These laws are the same as for a gas mixed with
air under the same conditions. The coefficient of the diffusion of the
emanation into air is equal to 0.100 at 10°. The coefficient is,
therefore, of the same order of magnitude as that of the diffusion of
carbon dioxide into the air, which is equal to 0.15 at the same
temperature.
</p>

<p>
<i>Radioactivity Induced by Thorium and the Emanation of
Thorium</i>.&mdash;Thorium emits an emanation and gives rise to the
phenomena of induced radioactivity. These properties have been made the
subject of numerous researches by Rutherford. The action of thorium is,
otherwise, considerably less intense than that of radium.
</p>
<p>
The emanation of thorium disappears spontaneously according to a simple
exponential law, but its disappearance is much more rapid than that of
the emanation of radium. The quantity of the emanation from thorium
diminishes by one-half in about one minute and ten seconds, while in the
case of radium the quantity falls to one half in four days. This
considerable difference causes a profound difference in the aspect of
the phenomena.
</p>
<p>
In a closed space of not too great dimensions the emanation from radium
spreads almost uniformly into all parts. But under the same conditions
the emanation of thorium is found to accumulate in the vicinity of the
thorium, because it disappears spontaneously before it has time to
diffuse any considerable distance into the air.
</p>
<p>
The radiant activity of a substance can be measured by placing it upon
the lower plate of a condenser formed of two horizontal plates, and
measuring the conductivity communicated to the air between the plates.
If this measurement be made with oxide of thorium, it is found that the
conductivity of the air is greatly decreased when a current of air is
sent between the plates. The oxide of thorium emits, indeed, an
emanation that accumulates upon the substance and by its radiation helps
to ionize the air between the plates. A current of air carries away the
emanation as rapidly as it is set free, and the only thing left to cause
ionization is the Becquerel radiation coming directly from the thorium.
</p>
<p>
If the same experiment be repeated with a salt of radium it is found
that the current of air produces only a feeble effect. With uranium and
polonium, which do not emit the emanation, the current of air has no
effect. On the contrary, in the case of actinium, the action of the
current of air is to suppress four-fifths of the conductivity of the
air. It may be concluded that for thorium, and especially for actinium,
the radiation of the emanation is very important in comparison with the
radiation of the radioactive substance itself.
</p>
<p>
When one wishes to excite a solid to saturation with the emanation from
thorium, it is necessary to cause the emanation to act for a long time,
and hence new supplies of it must be brought continually to the surface
of the body that is to be excited. To do this a current of air is passed
through a solution of a salt of thorium and, then this current, of air
charged with the emanation, is passed over the body. The solid, when
excited by the emanation from thorium, loses its activity spontaneously
according to an exponential law. The radiation falls to one-half every
eleven hours. Hence, contrary to what takes place with the emanations,
the activity induced by thorium upon solid substances disappears more
slowly than that induced by radium.
</p>

<p>
<i>Radioactivity Induced by Actinium and the Emanation from
Actinium</i>.&mdash;Actinium emits an emanation which gives a very
intense radiation. This emanation disappears spontaneously with extreme
rapidity, and diminishes by one-half in about one second. In air at the
atmospheric pressure the emanation emitted by actinium cannot propagate
itself to a greater distance than 7 or 8 mm. from the active substance,
and excites bodies only when they are placed very near the source. On
the contrary, in a vacuum the diffusion is rapid, and a body placed 10
cm. away from the actinium can be excited. The radioactivity induced by
the actinium upon solids disappears according to an exponential law. It
diminishes to one-half in about thirty-six minutes.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Concentration of Induced Radioactivity upon Bodies Charged
Negatively</i>.&mdash;Rutherford showed that a body exposed to the
emanation from thorium became much more active when it was charged
negatively than when it was at the same potential as the surrounding
objects. On the contrary, it became less excited when it had a positive
potential. The same phenomenon is noticed in the case of the excitation
by radium and actinium. The nature of this curious phenomenon seems to
me not to be well established.
</p>

<p>
<i>Condensation of the Emanations from Radium and
Thorium</i>.&mdash;Rutherford and Soddy discovered that the emanations
from radium and thorium can be condensed at the temperature of liquid
air. A current of air charged with the emanation loses its radioactive
properties when passing through a coil of tube plunged in liquid air.
The emanations remain condensed in the tube, and can be restored to the
gaseous state when it is warmed. The emanation from radium condenses at
-150°, while that from thorium condenses between -100° and -150°. The
experiment can be performed as follows: Two glass reservoirs, one large
and the other small, communicate with one another. They are filled with
gas excited by radium. The small reservoir is plunged in liquid air. The
large reservoir then rapidly becomes inactive, while all the activity is
concentrated in the small reservoir. If the two are then disconnected,
and the small one be taken from the liquid air, it is seen that the
large reservoir is not at all luminous, while the small one gives off
more light than at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment is a
very brilliant one if the walls of the reservoirs are coated inside with
phosphorescent sulphide of zinc.
</p>
<p>
When a platinum wire excited by thorium or radium is heated to redness,
it loses most of its activity. Fanny Cook Gates showed that this
radioactivity is transferred to cold solids placed in the vicinity of
the wire. It distils in some way, at a sufficiently high temperature,
passing through the intermediate form of a gaseous emanation. The
induced radioactivity of solids would thus be analogous to a condensed
emanation.
</p>

<p>
<i>Activity Induced by Remaining in Solution in a Radioactive Liquid.
Uranium X. Thorium X</i>.&mdash;Certain substances are temporarily
excited when they stay in the same solution with radioactive substances.
Giesel and Mme. Curie prepared active bismuth by dissolving one of its
salts in the solution of a salt of radium. Debierne also excited a salt
of barium in a solution of a salt of actinium. The barium salt thus
excited presents certain analogies to the salt of radium, and can be
fractionated in the same way. By crystallization the active chloride is
concentrated in the salt that is deposited.
</p>
<p>
By various methods of chemical precipitation the activity of uranium has
been divided (Crookes, Soddy, Rutherford and Grier, Debierne,
Becquerel). For instance, barium chloride is added to a solution of
uranyl nitrate, and the barium is then precipitated by adding a little
sulphuric acid. The precipitated barium sulphate, when separated and
dried, is radioactive. It has carried with it a part of the activity of
the uranium, for the uranium salt, when the solution is evaporated to
dryness, is less active than before it was submitted to this operation.
But after several months the sulphate of barium loses its radioactivity,
while the uranium salt has regained its original properties. It is
evident that the barium was excited by contact with the uranium, or that
it occluded in some special form a part of the activity of the uranium
(uranium X of Crookes).
</p>
<p>
Rutherford and Soddy showed that if nitrate of thorium is precipitated
by ammonia, the precipitated oxide of thorium is less active than
ordinary thorium. The liquid from which it was precipitated is
radioactive, and on evaporating it to dryness the small residue is 2,500
times more active than the thoria (they call the radioactive substance
in this residue thorium X). After several weeks the residue has lost its
activity, the thorium X has disappeared, and the thoria which was
precipitated has, on the contrary, regained its normal activity.
Further, while the thorium X existed it emitted the thorium emanation in
abundance.
</p>
<p>
Rutherford and Soddy think that uranium X and thorium X are simply
intermediate products of the breaking down of uranium and thorium.
Thorium, for example, produces thorium X continuously, which breaks down
into the emanation of thorium, that is in its turn transformed into
induced activity.
</p>

<p>
<i>Conductivity of Atmospheric Air. Emanation and Induced Radioactivity
at the Surface of the Earth</i>&mdash;Elster and Geitel, and also
Wilson, showed that atmospheric air conducts electricity to a slight
extent, that it is always slightly ionized. This ionization seems to be
due to various causes. According to the work of Elster and Geitel,
atmospheric air always contains a small proportion of an emanation
analogous to that emitted by radioactive substances. Metallic wires
suspended in the air and kept at a high negative potential become active
under the influence of this emanation. At the summits of high mountains
the atmosphere contains more of the emanation than on plains or at the
level of the sea. The air of caves and caverns is especially highly
charged with the emanation. Air rich in the emanation can also be
obtained by aspirating, by means of a tube sunk in the earth the air
which is contained in it. The air extracted from certain mineral waters
contains the emanation, while the air dissolved in the water of the sea
and of the rivers is almost free from it.
</p>
<p>
The conductivity of the atmosphere is also probably due in part to very
penetrating radiations that traverse space, and of which the origin is
unknown. Finally, it is probable that all bodies are slightly
radioactive, and that those at the surface of the ground render the air
around them a conductor of electricity.
</p>

<p>
<i>Time-Constants that Characterize the Disappearance of Emanations and
of Induced Radioactivity</i>.&mdash;We have seen that the radioactive
emanations and the induced radioactivity of solids disappear
spontaneously, and that the law of their disappearance is, in general, a
simple exponential law. The intensity of the radiation, <img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm I\)">,
is given as a function of the time, <img style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.441ex;" src="images/24.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(t\)">, by the formula,
</p>

<p><br></p>

<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.685ex; width: 10.178ex; height: 2.501ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm I = \mathrm I_{0}e^{-at}.
\end{aligned}
\]"></span>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<img style="vertical-align: 0; width: 0.817ex; height: 1.545ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\mathrm I\)"><sub>0</sub> is the intensity of the initial radiation,
and <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/25.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(a\)"> a constant. This exponential law is completely defined by the
knowledge of a constant of time that may be, for example, the inverse of
<img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.197ex; height: 1.02ex;" src="images/25.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(a\)"> in the preceding formula. One may also take as the constant
the time necessary for the intensity of the radiation to diminish
to one-half.
</p>
<p>
It is very remarkable that these constants of time seem to be invariable
under widely different circumstances. Thus it is that the emanation from
radium diminishes to one-half during each period of four hours, whatever
may be the conditions of the experiment, and whatever the temperature
between -180° and +450°. The rate of its disappearance is the same
whether the emanation be in the gaseous state (room temperature) or
condensed (-180°). The properties of the emanation from radium thus
give us an invariable standard of time which is independent of all
agreements as to the unit.
</p>
<p>
The time-constants of the radioactivity serve to characterize in a
precise manner the nature of the different radioactive energies.
</p>
<p>
The following are the times necessary for the activity to fall
to one-half of its value:

<p>
Thus J. J. Thomson and Adam found recently that the emanation from water
from certain sources falls to one-half for each period of four days, and
that this emanation causes induced activity in solids which falls to
one-half in about forty minutes. The supposition is that the emanation
contained in the water is due to radium.
</p>
<p>
Ordinary thorium extracted from monazite sand is slightly radioactive.
Thorium from pitchblende is strongly radioactive (thorium with actinium
of Debierne). The radioactivity in the two cases is not due to the same
substance, for the time-constants of the emanation and of the
radioactivity are different.
</p>
<p>
Certain radioactive substances like actinium have never been separated
in a pure state, and it may be supposed that the very active substances
that have been studied contain only traces of them. The chemical
reactions of substances cannot be recognized with certainty when they
are found solely in a diluted condition, mixed with other substances.
Under those circumstances one element may carry another down with it in
a precipitation, and the action of the reagent is not the same as when
we have pure compounds. Hence the chemical reactions will not serve to
characterize a radioactive substance. It may, however, be recognized
under all circumstances by the time constants of the emanation it emits,
and of the induced radioactivity excited by that emanation upon solids.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nature of the Emanation</i>.&mdash;According to Rutherford, the
emanation of a radioactive substance is a radioactive, material
gas which escapes from it. In fact, the emanation from radium
acts in many ways like a gas.
</p>
<p>
When we put in communication two glass reservoirs, one containing the
emanation and the other none, the emanation diffuses into the second
and, when equilibrium is established, it is found that the emanation is
divided between the two reservoirs according to their respective
volumes. One of the two may be heated to 350°, while the other remains
at the room temperature, and it is found that in this case, also, the
emanation is divided between the two reservoirs as if it were a perfect
gas obeying the laws of Marriotte and Gay-Lussac.
</p>
<p>
We have also seen that the emanation from radium diffuses into the air
according to the law of the diffusion of gases, and with a coefficient
of diffusion comparable with that of carbon dioxide. Finally, the
emanations from radium and thorium condense at low temperatures like
liquefiable gases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time it should be remembered that no one has yet observed
any pressure due to the emanation, nor has any one shown by weighing
that a material gas is present. All our knowledge of the properties of
the emanation results from measurements of radioactivity. More than
that, no one has yet shown with certitude that there is a characteristic
spectrum produced by the emanation.
</p>
<p>
The emanation should also not be considered as an ordinary material gas,
for it disappears spontaneously from a sealed tube containing it, and
the rapidity of its disappearance is absolutely independent of the
conditions of the experiment, especially of the temperature.
</p>
<p>
It is very curious that the numerous attempts made under the most varied
conditions to obtain chemical reactions with the emanation have been
fruitless. To explain this fact Rutherford thinks that the emanations
are gases of the argon family.
</p>
<p>
The following facts are difficult to explain. The emanation from radium
condenses at -150°, and according to Rutherford, a current of air at
-153° may be passed over it continuously without removing it. The
amount of the emanation must be very small, and if it had the slightest
tension at -153°, it would quickly evaporate in a current of air.
Further, the temperature of condensation by cooling should be a function
of the amount of the emanation in a given volume of air, which has not
yet been proved.
</p>
<p>
Debierne and I have found that the emanation passes with extreme ease
through the tiniest holes and fissures in solids, while under the same
conditions the ordinary gases could circulate only with the greatest
slowness.
</p>
<p>
Rutherford supposes that radium destroys itself spontaneously, and that
the emanation is one of the products of the breaking-down. Debierne and
I observed that a solid salt of radium quite rapidly excites the walls
of the reservoir filled with air, which contains it, by the emanation
which it emits. On the contrary, if a quite perfect vacuum be made in
the reservoir the excitation takes place only with extreme slowness; but
it rapidly reappears when a gas has been admitted. However, the
emanation spreads much more rapidly in a gas at very low pressure than
at the atmospheric pressure. It seems from this that the emanation
experiences some particular difficulty in escaping from radium which is
in a vacuum.
</p>

<p>
<i>Disengagement of Gas by the Salts of Radium. Production of
Helium</i>.&mdash;Giesel noticed that solutions of radium bromide
continually give off gases. These gases are principally hydrogen and
oxygen, in the same relative proportion as in water, and might,
therefore, come from the decomposition of the water of the solution. But
Ramsay and Soddy also showed that there always is a small quantity of
helium that they detected by its spectrum in a Geissler tube. The helium
lines were also accompanied by three unknown lines.
</p>
<p>
A solid salt of radium also constantly gives off gases capable of
producing a pressure in a closed tube. To this liberation of gas can be
attributed two accidents during my experiments. A sealed bulb of thin
glass, almost filled with well-dried bromide of radium, exploded and
became slightly warm at the same time. An explosion was also caused by
dry radium chloride when heated quite rapidly in a vacuum to 300°. In
this case the explosion seemed to be caused by fragments of the solid
salt filled with occluded gas.
</p>
<p>
At the moment we dissolve in water a solid salt of radium that has been
prepared a long time, there is an abundant evolution of gas.
</p>
<p>
The spontaneous production of helium in a sealed tube containing radium
is plainly a new fact of fundamental importance. Ramsay and Soddy
accumulated some of the emanation from radium, and enclosed it in a
Geissler tube at low pressure. They obtained new lines which they
attributed to the emanation, and they also showed that the spectrum of
helium was absent at first, but that it came into being little by little
in the tube. According to that, helium must be one of the products of
the disintegration of radium.
</p>
<p>
In support of the preceding results may be mentioned some points noticed
by Mme. Curie and me at the beginning of our work. We were struck by the
simultaneous occurrence of uranium, radium, and helium in the same
mineral. We took 50 kilograms of commercial barium chloride, coming from
minerals that did not contain uranium, and submitted it to fractional
crystallization to see whether it contained traces of radium chloride.
After a prolonged fractionation, the portion at the head, now reduced to
a few grams, was not at all radioactive. Hence, barium contains radium
only when it comes from uranium minerals. These are the same that
contain helium. One might think that there is a relation of cause and
effect from the simultaneous occurrence of these three substances.
</p>
<p>
This rapid summary of the researches on radioactivity serves to show the
importance of the scientific movement that has been started by the study
of this phenomenon. The results obtained are of a nature to modify the
ideas one might have about the invariability of the atom, the
conservation of matter and of energy, the nature of the mass of bodies,
and the energy spread through space. The most fundamental questions of
science are thus brought into the discussion. Apart from the theoretical
interest of which they are the object, the phenomena of radioactivity
give new means of action to the physicist, the chemist, the
physiologist, and the physician.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
